### Assessment

The Bill aims to make several significant changes to the higher education landscape in the United States. Here are some key points of assessment:

1. **Asset Exemption**: The exemption of certain assets from financial aid calculations could make higher education more accessible to students from families with family farms, small businesses, or commercial fishing businesses.
2. **Loan Limits and Repayment**: The establishment of new loan limits and repayment plans could provide more manageable repayment options for borrowers, particularly those with lower incomes. The transition to income-based repayment plans and the elimination of income contingent repayment plans could simplify the repayment process.
3. **Pell Grants**: The inclusion of foreign income in the calculation of adjusted gross income for Federal Pell Grant eligibility could ensure that more students receive the financial aid they need. The establishment of the Workforce Pell Grant program could provide additional opportunities for students to pursue workforce-focused education.
4. **Accountability**: The establishment of ineligibility for certain programs based on low earning outcomes could hold institutions of higher education accountable for the success of their graduates.
5. **Regulatory Relief**: The delay of certain regulations relating to borrower defense to repayment and closed school discharges could provide temporary relief for institutions of higher education.
6. **Garden of Heroes and Office of Refugee Resettlement**: The appropriations for the Garden of Heroes and the Office of Refugee Resettlement reflect the Bill's broader focus on national heritage and the resettlement of unaccompanied alien children.

Overall, the Bill represents a comprehensive approach to addressing various aspects of higher education, from financial aid and loan repayment to accountability and regulatory relief. The appropriations included in the Bill provide necessary funding for specific initiatives and programs.
