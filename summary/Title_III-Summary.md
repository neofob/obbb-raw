The introduction of a Repayment Assistance Plan and stricter repayment terms seeks to make loan repayment more manageable.

3. **Pell Grant Enhancements:** The creation of Workforce Pell Grants and adjustments to eligibility criteria aim to make higher education more affordable and accessible, particularly for low- and middle-income students.

4. **Accountability Measures:** The reimbursement requirements for institutions based on non-repayment balances and the introduction of PROMISE grants incentivize institutions to improve outcomes for students and ensure better value for federal investments.

5. **Regulatory Relief:** The repeal of certain regulations, such as the 90/10 rule and gainful employment regulations, along with the restoration of previous regulations, aims to reduce regulatory burdens on institutions while maintaining protections for students.
