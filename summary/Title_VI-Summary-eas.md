2. **Funding for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts**:
   - Section 60025 appropriates $256,657,000 for fiscal year 2025 for capital repair, restoration, maintenance backlog, and security structures of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. This funding is available until September 30, 2029, with up to 3% allowed for administrative costs.

3. **Project Sponsor Opt-in Fees for Environmental Reviews**:
   - Section 60026 amends the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to include a new section (Section 112) that establishes a process for project sponsors to pay fees for the preparation or supervision of environmental assessments or impact statements. The fees are set at 125% of the anticipated costs, with deadlines for completion of the reviews.

### Estimate of Total Spending

The only new spending mentioned in Title VI is for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which is $256,657,000. All other sections involve rescissions of unobligated balances, meaning they do not add to the total spending but rather reduce previously allocated funds.

### Assessment

The bill appears to be focused on reducing environmental and public works funding by rescinding unobligated balances from various programs. This could be seen as a cost-cutting measure, potentially aimed at reallocating funds to other priorities or reducing the federal budget deficit. However, the rescissions could also impact ongoing environmental initiatives and programs aimed at reducing pollution, addressing climate change, and promoting sustainable practices.

The appropriation for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is a notable exception, providing significant funding for the maintenance and security of a prominent cultural institution. This suggests a priority on cultural preservation and infrastructure.

Overall, the bill seems to reflect a shift in funding priorities, with a significant reduction in environmental program funding and a targeted investment in cultural infrastructure. The impact of these changes would depend on the specific programs affected and the broader context of federal budgeting and policy goals.
