### Summary of the Bill Title

The proposed bill under Title IX of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform includes several key provisions aimed at reforming federal employee benefits and the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) claims process. Here's a summary of the main sections:

1. **Elimination of the FERS Annuity Supplement for Certain Employees (SEC. 90001):**
   - Amends Section 8421(a) of title 5, United States Code, to eliminate the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) annuity supplement for individuals separated from service under Section 8425 or entitled to an annuity under subsection (d) or (e) of Section 8412.
   - The amendments will begin to apply on January 1, 2028, and will not apply to individuals already entitled to an annuity supplement before that date.

2. **Election for At-Will Employment and Lower FERS Contributions for New Federal Civil Service Hires (SEC. 90002):**
   - Adds a new section (3330g) to Subchapter I of Chapter 33 of title 5, United States Code, allowing new federal civil service hires to make an irrevocable election to be employed on an at-will basis.
   - At-will employees can be subject to adverse actions, including removal, without notice or right to appeal, for any cause.
   - Individuals who do not make this election will be subject to standard FERS contribution requirements, increased by 5 percentage points.

3. **Filing Fee for Merit Systems Protection Board Claims and Appeals (SEC. 90003):**
   - Amends Section 7701 of title 5, United States Code, to establish and collect a filing fee for claims or appeals filed with the MSPB.
   - The fee will be equal to the filing fee for a civil action under Section 1914(a) of title 28 and will be returned if the individual is the prevailing party.
   - The fee will not be required for actions brought by the Special Counsel or for certain prohibited personnel practices.
   - The fee will be deposited into the miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury if the individual is not the prevailing party.

4. **FEHB Protection (SEC. 90004):**
   - Amends the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program to include verification requirements for qualifying life events and family member eligibility.
   - Requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to conduct fraud risk assessments and comprehensive audits regarding family members covered under FEHB.
   - Develops a process for disenrolling or removing individuals who are not eligible to be covered under FEHB.
   - Provides funding for oversight and audit activities associated with FEHB, including the Postal Service Health Benefits Program.

### Analysis

The bill aims to make several significant changes to federal employee benefits and the MSPB claims process:

1. **FERS Annuity Supplement Elimination:**
   - This provision targets the FERS annuity supplement, which is an additional payment for federal employees who retire before reaching full Social Security retirement age. By eliminating this supplement for certain employees, the bill seeks to reduce federal retirement costs.

2. **At-Will Employment Option:**
   - The introduction of an at-will employment option for new federal hires is a substantial shift in employment practices. At-will employment means that employees can be terminated for any reason, with or without cause, and without the usual protections and appeal processes. This provision could make federal employment less attractive and potentially lead to a more transient workforce.

3. **MSPB Filing Fee:**
   - The establishment of a filing fee for MSPB claims and appeals is intended to reduce frivolous claims and ensure that only serious cases are brought forward. However, it could also create a financial barrier for employees who wish to challenge adverse actions, potentially limiting their access to justice.

4. **FEHB Program Reforms:**
   - The reforms to the FEHB program focus on verifying the eligibility of family members and preventing fraud. This includes comprehensive audits and the development of processes to disenroll ineligible individuals. These measures aim to ensure that the program is used appropriately and to reduce costs.

### Potential Impact

- **Federal Employees:** The changes to FERS, at-will employment, and MSPB fees could significantly impact federal employees' job security, retirement benefits, and ability to challenge adverse actions. These provisions may make federal employment less desirable and could affect recruitment and retention efforts.

- **Federal Agencies:** The introduction of at-will employment could give agencies more flexibility in managing their workforce but may also lead to higher turnover and reduced morale. The reforms to FEHB could help control costs but may require additional administrative resources.

- **Government Operations:** The overall impact on government operations will depend on how these changes are implemented. The reforms aim to reduce costs and improve efficiency, but they may also introduce new challenges and complexities.

In conclusion, the bill proposes significant reforms to federal employee benefits and the MSPB claims process, with potential impacts on job security, retirement benefits, and healthcare eligibility. The changes aim to reduce costs and improve efficiency but may also present challenges for federal employees and agencies.
