for Medicare & Medicaid Services certifies that such project, or, in the case

in an increase in the amount of Federal expenditures compared to the amount
that such expenditures would otherwise be in the absence of such project. For
purposes of this subsection, expenditures for the coverage of populations and
services that the State could have otherwise provided through its Medicaid
State plan or other authority under title XIX, including expenditures that

period for such project for purposes of taking the difference between such
expenditures into account._ ”.

furnished to individuals described in clause (iii), broken down by type of
service;_

“(II) _with respect to each type of home or community-based service provided
under the waiver, the length of time that such individuals have received such
service;_

“(III) _a comparison between the data described in subclause (I) and any
comparable data available with respect to individuals with respect to whom a
determination described in paragraph (1) has been made and with respect to
individuals receiving institutional care under this title; and_

“(IV) _the number of individuals who have received home or community-based
